# Test and template for Rmd slide (using Padova un-official template) 



## System specifications

We run all the code on Windows 10 (we'll have tested them on MAC very soon).

To setup your PC to be able to run all the present code you need __R__ 
(ver 3.3.0+), __pandoc__ (to compile the Rmarkdown
file) and a LaTeX distribution (we assume a complete TeXLive distribution is installed).

All the R-packages are installed (if needed) and load automatically by
the scripts itselves.


## Installing

- Download the template at <http://www.math.unipd.it/~burattin/other/tema-latex-beamer-padova/> provided by Andrea Burattin.

- go to the one of the following folder responding on your system (or create if it not exists):

    + __Windows XP__ C:\\Documents and Settings\\<user name>\\texmf\\tex\\latex\\local\\
    + __Windows Vista/7/10__ C:\\Users\\<user name>\\texmf\\tex\\latex\\local\\
    + __Linux__ ~/texmf/tex/latex/local/
    + __Mac OS X__ /Users/<user name>/Library/texmf/tex/latex/local/

- Save there the *Padova* folder contining the theme.
